## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Wake policy with battery floor, mains-only and Low Power Mode guardrails
- Agent session tracking with staleness expiry, so a crashed agent cannot pin the Mac awake
- Unprivileged `IOPMAssertion` wake hold
- System-wide power assertion readout — shows every reason the Mac is awake, not just ours
- Pluggable clamshell backend (sudoers now, `SMAppService` helper once signed)
- Universal build, bundle and ad-hoc signing with Command Line Tools only
- Menu bar panel, settings window, and one-click hook setup
- Integrations for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI and Cursor
- Notifications when a run finishes or a guardrail cuts one short
- Lid-closed support behind a scoped sudoers helper
- ⌥⌘L to toggle the manual hold from anywhere
- Thermal ceiling: the hold is released when the Mac runs hot
- The panel says when an agent's hooks are out of date, with one action to fix it

### Fixed
- Claude Code's `Stop` event is listened for again, so a finished turn releases
  the hold immediately instead of waiting out the staleness window
- Gemini CLI reports `SessionEnd`, so a session torn down without a closing
  `AfterAgent` no longer holds the Mac awake until it expires
- An agent set up by an older version of Vigil is now visible as out of date
  rather than silently reporting less than Vigil listens for
- Session staleness is measured on a monotonic clock, so a clock correction
  cannot leave a dead session holding the Mac awake indefinitely
- Two agents that hand out the same session id are tracked as two sessions
  instead of merging into one attributed to the wrong agent
- Clicking the menu bar icon while the panel is open closes it, instead of
  closing and immediately reopening it
- The panel resizes when its content changes while it is open, rather than
  clipping the rows that appeared
- A prompt containing non-ASCII characters no longer makes the hook drop the
  whole event
- The hook no longer waits forever for a host that does not close its stdin
- A read-only settings file is refused rather than silently replaced, its
  permissions are preserved, and a file with comments in it says so
- Vigil no longer rewrites a settings file when the contents would not change
- The assertion ledger is only sampled while the panel is open
