## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Wake policy with battery floor, mains-only and Low Power Mode guardrails
- Agent session tracking with staleness expiry, so a crashed agent cannot pin the Mac awake
- Unprivileged `IOPMAssertion` wake hold
- System-wide power assertion readout — shows every reason the Mac is awake, not just ours
- Pluggable clamshell backend (sudoers now, `SMAppService` helper once signed)
- Universal build, bundle and ad-hoc signing with Command Line Tools only
